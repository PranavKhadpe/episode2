    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container" style="font-family: Avenir">
    
    <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">You will now perform a similar task as last time, only this time the proposed projects have changed and at some points during the conversation an agent will intervene to facilitate</h4>
    <p>As part of this activity, you will collaborate as a team to decide how to allocate funds for different projects as described below. Once all your teammates have arrived, you will be allowed to send messages through the chat. Your group will have <strong>20</strong> minutes to deliberate after which the chat will be disabled. The chat will give you a prompt 60 seconds before the end.</p>
    <p>You must evaluate competing requests for funding and make judgements about their relative merit. Many
            programs have merit, but limited resources require that you select the programs that you prefer to fund. You
            have discretionary funds available, and a number of projects are requesting access to these funds. Your job
            is to select those that should receive support. Your goal in selecting projects for funding is to choose those
            programs that agree with your personal values.
            Begin when you are ready</p>
    <div style="padding: 5px; border: solid 2px black; border-radius:5px;">
    <p>Personal Trust Foundation: $500,000</p>
    <p>You have $500,000 to allocate from this fund. Proposals received from various organizations for projects are
            listed below. Each project is in need of $500,000 but can benefit from any contribution that you might make.
            The greater the contribution that you make to a particular project, the more likely it is that the chosen project
            will succeed.</p>
    <p>Proposed Projects:</p>
    <ol style="font-weight: bold">
            <li>To establish a community arts program featuring art, music, and dance
                    programs for children and adults.</li>
            <li>To establish an additional shelter for the homeless in the state</li>
            <li>To purchase art for display in the state's art gallery</li>
            
        </ol>
    <p>Discuss with your team on how the money should be distributed across projects. After the deliberation ends, click the button on the right and you will be prompted to enter your final decision. <strong>Click the DONE button under the chat once you have reached a conclusion or after the time expires. it will open up a form where you can enter the final decision individually</strong></p>
